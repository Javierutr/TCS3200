# TCS3200
Simple TCS3200 libraries with instructions.

The SimpleTCS3200 library will let you easily get the RGB (0-255) values of whatever object you place in front of your sensor, given the pins to which you have connected the TCS3200 sensor.

The translateColour library is an extremely simple and foolproof implementation of a color recognition algorythm: you need to read the RGB values of some sample colors and specify them in the library. The program only compares a RGB vector with the predefined colours.

An automated calibration library is soon to come.

Thank you for your time. I created this library for a simple project, and works well enough. As simple as it may be, its simplicity makes it really easy to use. Examples are provided.
